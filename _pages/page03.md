### "It's not you, it's your empty bank account"

All women are gold-diggers to different degrees. Most just want financial stability, they want you to have a job, be able to afford a dinner out every week and a summer holiday. Some women just take this further.  No matter what feminists try to preach in schools and the media, women have evolved to be dependent on men. Unlike men they do not feel the same sense of shame at not being self-reliant. If a woman loses her job, she can happily mooch off guys for a long time until something else comes along. A woman's identity largely derives from the status of her partner. A man's identity is derived from what he does. I think this is why men tend to be makers and earners, and women are leechers and spenders.

To put this in perspective, in a hunter/gatherer society back then, one would achieve this characteristic by being proficient at hunting and being a good provider/protector for his family. Nowadays, its clearly different lawl. Women value dominance which is defined in by wealth.
