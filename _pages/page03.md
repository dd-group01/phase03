<section class="snap intro"><div class="module">All women are <b>gold-diggers</b> to different degrees. Most just want financial stability, they want you to have a job, be able to afford a dinner out every week and a summer holiday: women have evolved to be <b>dependent</b> on men. A woman’s identity largely derives from the status of her partner. A man’s identity is derived from what he does. I think this is why men tend to be makers and earners, and <b>women are leechers and spenders</b>. All women are gold diggers.
