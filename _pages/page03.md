### "It's not you, it's your empty bank account"

Women want to be comfortable, they want to create the best possible life for themselves. If they can get any man in this world, why look for someone who cannot provide anything to them? Love is possible to find in any human being, rich or poor. For that reason focusing the search in the wealthy department is only a strategy in to achieving what you know you have the capacity for. 
So, if a women is interested in a man, then she is interested in him for what she thinks he can do for her, whether that be his treasure, attention, security, servitude, etc. And of course, cash is the king!!
