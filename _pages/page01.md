<section class="snap intro"><div class="module">How often have you heard a <b>woman's bitchy behavior</b> be written off as <b>PMS</b> or "She must be going through her cycle". Culturally, it's called <b>being a bitch</b> and refusing to <b>adult</b> about your bleeding. Everyone knows you can control it, and actively choose not to. Men just pay the price because you're a fucking irrational child.</div></section>
