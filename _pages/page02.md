**Description**
One of the biggest example of hypocrisy for women is when they act/dress like whores (somehow this is supposed to be empowering for them) and at the same time demand to be respected and treated equally. No accountability whatsoever for their choice to represent themselves that way. If a guy dresses like a slob and acts like a slob he is not representing himself in a way that should garner respect.
