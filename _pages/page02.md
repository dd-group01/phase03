<section class="snap intro"><div class="module">One of the biggest example of hypocrisy for women is when they act/dress like whores (somehow this is supposed to be empowering for them) and at the same time demand to be respected and treated equally. Otherwise feminists focus only on those situations in which women are apparently oppressed, and which benefit their cause. There is a core of hate within feminism. It is a plague upon the world, it is dishonest, cultish and detrimental to the advancement of society.
